vampire slayer/rift mechanics from hypixel skyblock

buncha small boss attacks that combine together
based purely on mouse cursor position

need to hold down button for 3 seconds to start boss

boss tiers
    later tiers are essentially stat checks that soft-require new gear

player heals to full health with right click ability and uses 40 mana


materials gained from defeating boss
better materials from having more magic extract
excess mana regened goes towards magic extract
magic extract deactivated on first boss attempt for its tier

different bosses in different dimensions with entirely different mechanics and gear
can transfer some gear across dimensions for a progression system

not supposed to complete highest tier of bosses in early game, instead complete lower tiers and go to next dimension for next boss after tier III
