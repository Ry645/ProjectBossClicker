vampire slayer/rift mechanics from hypixel skyblock

buncha small boss attacks that combine together
based purely on mouse cursor position

need to hold down button for 3 seconds to start boss

boss tiers
	later tiers are essentially stat checks that soft-require new gear

player heals to full health with right click ability and uses 40 mana


materials gained from defeating boss
better materials from having more infusion meter

different bosses in different dimensions with entirely different mechanics and gear
can transfer some gear across dimensions for a progression system

not supposed to complete highest tier of bosses in early game, instead complete lower tiers and go to next dimension for next boss after tier III

infusion orbs cost entire mana pool to collect
hover over for one second to collect
5 max infusion meter
infusion orbs only appear when fighting tier v and above

tier v boss has attack that will kill player without special upgrade and progress to next dimension automatically
player unlocks ability to dimension hop and transfer items when attempting to kill tier v of final boss
coincidentally infustion orbs can appear then


game starts by clicking and holding on button for 3 seconds that turns a vault door to open to the boss
tier V of final boss will rip the door open

maybe have boss weakpoints that occasionally appear on the boss
hitting these does extra damage and contributes towards infusion orb spawns
