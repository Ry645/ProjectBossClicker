don't use texture progress or nine patch
instead use a moving texture rect with a shader to create the health bar

shader makes the left side of the health bar disappear as the right side moves to the left
the other way around for moving to the right

at very end of health bar (ie small sliver)
make right bar disappear from left to right to prevent clipping

everything controlled by proportion filled variable via game logic and health system
